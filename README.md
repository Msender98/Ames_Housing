Using the Ames, Iowa Housing Price dataset from kaggle for a machine learning project completed as a student at the NYC Data Science Academy.

The project was completed with a series of jupyter notebooks. Analysis.ipynb shows the final analysis using the models and cleaned sales data built in other notebooks in the Archive folder. Final_Model.ipynb builds and outputs the models used in Analysis. Other notebooks include other models and analysis that were not used in the end. 

The pickles folder includes saved model and dataframe objects.  Location_model and residuals_model are the final trained models.
